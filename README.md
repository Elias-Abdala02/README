# README
I am a computer science student at the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán (UADY).
Throughout my studies, I have developed skills in programming and basic video editing.
Additionally, I have gained practical experience working in an ice factory and in a help desk position for a year two years ago.
Currently, I am exploring ways to generate income, considering freelance opportunities or starting my own business.
